# NewsApp

Android application that fetches and displays a feed of news content from a given api url. The application implements a bottom navigation that filters list items based on "Content Package", "Story" and "Stub". <br />

Created a database for storage to support offline persistence of data <br />
Used Retrofit/Rxjava for API Data Interaction <br />
Used Fresco to load images from the url on App startup.
